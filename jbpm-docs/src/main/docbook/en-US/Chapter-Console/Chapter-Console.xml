  <title>Console</title>

  <para>Business processes can be managed through a web console.  This includes
  features like managing your process instances (starting/stopping/inspecting),
  inspecting your (human) task list and executing those tasks, and generating
  reports.</para>

  <para>The jBPM console consists of two wars that must be deployed in your
  application server and contains the necessary libraries, the actual application,
  etc.  One jar contains the server application, the other one the client.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Installation</title>

    <para>The easiest way to get started with the console is probably to use the installer.
    This will download, install and configure all the necessary components to get the console running,
    including an in-memory database, a human task service, etc.  Check out the chapter on the
    installer for more information.</para>
    
    <para>The console is a separate sub-project that is shared across different projects, like for
    example jBPM and RiftSaw.  The source code of the version that jBPM5 is currently using can be found
    on SVN <ulink url="http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/soag/bpm-console/tags/bpm-console-2.1/">here</ulink>.
    The latest version of the console has been moved to Git and can be found 
    <ulink url="https://github.com/bpmc">here</ulink>.</para>
    
    <section>
      <title>Authorization</title>
      
       <para>The console requires users to log in before being to use the application.
       The console uses normal username / password authentication.  When using JBossAS
       for example, this can be specified in the users.properties file in the
       server/{profile}/conf folder.  There you can specify the combination of users that
       can log into the console and their password.</para>
       
       <para>When using the jBPM installer, a predefined users.properties file (located in
       the auth folder) is copied to the jbossas/server/default/conf folder automatically.
       This file can be edited and contains a few predefined users: admin, krisv, john,
       mary, and sales-rep (as these are commonly used in examples).  The password
       associated with these users is the same as their username.</para>
       
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>User and group management</title>
      
       <para>The human task service requires you to define which groups a user is
       part of, so that he can then claim the tasks that are assigned to one of the
       groups he is part of.  The console uses username / group association for that.
       When using JBossAS for example, this can be specified in the roles.properties
       file in the server/{profile}/conf folder.  There you can specify the combination
       of users and the groups they are part of.</para>
       
       <para>When using the jBPM installer, a predefined roles.properties file (located in
       the auth folder) is copied to the jbossas/server/default/conf folder automatically.
       This file can be edited and contains the groups the predefined users are part of
       (as these are commonly used in examples): all users are part of the admin, manager
       and user group but john is also part of the PM (project management) group, mary is
       part of HR (human resources) and sales-rep is part of sales.</para>
       
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Registering your own service handlers</title>
      
      <para>As explained in the chapter on domain-specific services, jBPM allows you to
      register your own domain-specific services as custom service tasks.  The process
      only contains a high-level description of the service that needs to be executed, and
      a handler is responsible for the actual implementation, i.e. invoking the
      service.</para>
      
      <para>You must register your handlers to be able to execute domain-specific services.
      You can register your handlers by dropping a configuration file in the classpath that
      specifies the implementation class for each of the handlers.  You can specify which
      configuration files must be loaded in the drools.session.conf file, using the
      drools.workItemHandlers property (as a list of space-separated file names).  These
      file names should contain a Map of entries, the name and the corresponding 
      WorkItemHandler instance that should be used to execute the service.  The 
      configuration file is using the MVEL script language to specify a map of type
      Map&lt;String,WorkItemHandler&gt;.</para>
      
      <para>You should also make sure that the implementation classes (and dependencies) are also
      available on the classpath of the server war, for example by dropping the necessary
      wars in the server/{profile}/lib directory of your JBossAS installation.</para>
      
      <para>For example, suggest you want to use the "Email" service task (that is provided
      out-of-the-box as an example in the jbpm-workitems module).  You should put the
      jbpm-workitems, javax.mail and javax.activation jars in the lib folder of the AS and
      the include the following two configuration files in the META-INF folder in the
      WEB-INF/classes folder of the server war. The drools.session.conf simply refers to
      the CustomWorkItemHandlers.conf file that contains the actual handlers:</para>
      
      <programlisting language="java">drools.workItemHandlers = CustomWorkItemHandlers.conf</programlisting>
      
      <para>This configuration file then specifies which handler to register for each of
      the domain-specific services that are being used, using MVEL to specify a
      Map&lt;String,WorkItemHandler&gt; (with host, port, username and password replaced
      by a meaningful value of course):</para>
      
      <programlisting language="java">[
  "Email": new org.jbpm.process.workitem.email.EmailWorkItemHandler(
             "host", "port", "username", "password"),  
]</programlisting>
      
      <para>The installer simplifies registering your own work item handlers significantly
      by offering these configuration files in the jbpm-installer/conf folder already
      and automatically copying them to the right location when installing the demo.  Simply
      update these files with your own entries before running ant install.demo.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Running the process management console</title>

    <para>Now navigate to the following URL (replace the host and/or port depending on how the application server
    is configured):
    <ulink url="http://localhost:8080/jbpm-console">http://localhost:8080/jbpm-console</ulink></para>

    <para>A login screen should pop up, asking for your user name and password.  By default, the
    following username/password configurations are supported: krisv/krisv, admin/admin, john/john
    and mary/mary.</para>

    <mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata align="center" format="PNG" role="" fileref="images/Chapter-Console/Login.png"/></imageobject></mediaobject>

    <para>After filling these in, the process management workbench should be opened, as shown in the
    screenshot below.  On the right you will see several tabs, related to process instance management,
    human task lists and reporting, as explained in the following sections.</para>

    <mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata align="center" format="PNG" role="" fileref="images/Chapter-Console/Tasks.png"/></imageobject></mediaobject>

    <section>
      <title>Managing process instances</title>

      <para>The "Processes" section allows you to inspect the process definitions that are currently
      part of the installed knowledge base, start new process instances and manage running process
      instances (which includes inspecting their state and data).</para>

      <section>
        <title>Inspecting process definitions</title>

      <para>When you open the process definition list, all known process definitions are shown.
      You can then either inspect process instances for one specific process or start a new 
      process instance.</para>

      <mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata align="center" format="PNG" role="" fileref="images/Chapter-Console/ProcessDefinitions.png"/></imageobject></mediaobject>

      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Starting new process instances</title>

      <para>To start a new process instance for one specific process definition, select the process
      definition in the process definition list.  Click on the "Start" button in the instances
      table to start a new instance of that specific process.  When a form is associated
      with this particular process (to ask for additional information before starting the process),
      this form will be shown.  After completing this form, the process will be started with the
      provided information.</para>

      <mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata align="center" format="PNG" role="" fileref="images/Chapter-Console/StartProcess.png"/></imageobject></mediaobject>

      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Managing process instances</title>

      <para>The process instances table shows all running instances of that specific process definition.
      Select a process instance to show the details of that specific process instance.</para>

      <mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata align="center" format="PNG" role="" fileref="images/Chapter-Console/ProcessInstances.png"/></imageobject></mediaobject>

      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Inspecting process instance state</title>

      <para>You can inspect the state of a specific process instance by clicking on
      the "Diagram" button.  This will show you the process flow chart, where a red
      triangle is shown at each node that is currently active (like for example a human
      task node waiting for the task to be completed or a join node waiting for more
      incoming connections before continuing). [Note that multiple instances of one node
      could be executing simultaneously. They will still be shown using only one red
      triangle.]</para>

      <mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata align="center" format="PNG" role="" fileref="images/Chapter-Console/ProcessInstanceDiagram.png"/></imageobject></mediaobject>

      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Inspecting process instance variables</title>

      <para>You can inspect the (top-level) variables of a specific process instance by clicking on
      the "Instance Data" button.  This will show you how each variable defined in the process
      maps to it's corresponding value for that specific process instance.</para>

      <mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata align="center" format="PNG" role="" fileref="images/Chapter-Console/ProcessInstanceData.png"/></imageobject></mediaobject>

      </section>

    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Human task lists</title>

    <para>The task management section allows a user to see his/her current task list.
    The group task list shows all the tasks that are not yet assigned to one specific
    user but that the currently logged in user could claim.  The personal task list shows
    all tasks that are assigned to the currently logged in user.  To execute a task,
    select it in your personal task list and select "View".  If a form is associated
    with the selected task (for example to ask for additional information), this form
    will be shown.  After completing the form, the task will also be completed.</para>

    <mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata align="center" format="PNG" role="" fileref="images/Chapter-Console/TaskForm.png"/></imageobject></mediaobject>

    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Reporting</title>

    <para>The reporting section allows you to view reports about the execution of
    processes.  This includes an overall report showing an overview of all processes,
    as shown below.</para>

    <mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata align="center" format="PNG" role="" fileref="images/Chapter-Console/ReportOverall.png"/></imageobject></mediaobject>

    <para>A report regarding one specific process instance can also be generated.</para>

    <mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata align="center" format="PNG" role="" fileref="images/Chapter-Console/ReportProcess.png"/></imageobject></mediaobject>

    <para>jBPM provides some sample reports that could be used to visualize some
    generic execution characteristics like the number of active process instances per
    process etc.  But custom reports could be generated to show the information your
    company thinks is important, by replacing the report templates in the report
    directory.</para>
    
    <para>The jBPM installer by default does not install the reporting engine (to limit
    the size of the download).  If you want to try out reporting, make sure to put the
    jBPM.birt.download property in the build.properties file to true before running the
    installer. If you get an exception that the report engine was not initialized
    correctly, please run the installer again after making sure that reporting is 
    enabled.</para>

    </section>

  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Adding new process / task forms</title>

  <para>Forms can be used to (1) start a new process or (2) complete a human task.
  We use freemarker templates to dynamically create forms. To create a form for a
  specific process definition, create a freemarker template with the name 
  {processId}.ftl.  The template itself should use HTML
  code to model the form.  For example, the form to start the evaluation process shown
  above is defined in the com.sample.evaluation.ftl file:</para>

  <programlisting language="html">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Start Performance Evaluation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;form action="complete" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt;
Please fill in your username: &lt;input type="text" name="employee" /&gt;&lt;/BR&gt;
&lt;input type="submit" value="Complete"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</programlisting>

  <para>Similarly, task forms for a specific type of human task (uniquely identified
  by its task name) can be linked to that human task by creating a freemarker template
  with the name {taskName}.ftl.  The form has access to a "task" parameter that represents
  the current human task, so it allows you to dynamically adjust the task form based on
  the task input.  The task parameter is a Task model object as defined in the
  jbpm-human-task module.  This for example allows you to customize the task form based
  on the description or input data related to that task.  For example, the evaluation form
  shown earlier uses the task parameter to access the description of the task and show that
  in the task form:</para>

  <programlisting language="html">
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Employee evaluation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
${task.descriptions[0].text}&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Please fill in the following evaluation form: 
&lt;form action="complete" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt;
Rate the overall performance: &lt;select name="performance"&gt;
&lt;option value="outstanding"&gt;Outstanding&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value="exceeding"&gt;Exceeding expectations&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value="acceptable"&gt;Acceptable&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option value="below"&gt;Below average&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Check any that apply:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox" name="initiative" value="initiative"&gt;Displaying initiative&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox" name="change" value="change"&gt;Thriving on change&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox" name="communication" value="communication"&gt;Good communication skills&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;input type="submit" value="Complete"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</programlisting>

  <para>Task forms also have access to the additional task parameters that might
  be mapped in the user task node from process variable using parameter mapping.
  Check out the chapter on human tasks for more details.  These task parameters
  are also directly accessible inside the task form.  For example, imagine that
  you want to make a task form for review customer requests.  The user task node
  copies the userId (of the customer that performed the request), the comment (the
  description of the request) and the date (the actual date and time of the request)
  from the process into the task as task parameters.  In that case, these parameters
  will then be accessible directly in the task form, as shown below:</para>

<programlisting>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Request Review&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
UserId: ${userId} &lt;br/&gt;
Description: ${description} &lt;br/&gt;
Date: ${date?date} ${date?time}
&lt;form action="complete" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt;
Comment:&lt;BR/&gt;
&lt;textarea cols="50" rows="5" name="comment"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/BR&gt;
&lt;input type="submit" name="outcome" value="Accept"&gt;
&lt;input type="submit" name="outcome" value="Reject"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</programlisting>

  <para>Data that is provided by the user when filling in the task form will be
  added as result parameters when completing the task.  The name of the data element
  will be used as the name of the result parameter. For example, when completing the
  first task above, the Map of outcome parameters will include result variables called
  "performance", "initiative", "change" and "communication".  The result parameters
  can be accessed in the related process by mapping these result parameters to process
  variables using result mapping.</para>

  <para>Forms should either be available on the classpath (for example inside a jar in the
  jbossas/server/default/lib folder or added to the set of sample forms in the
  jbpm-gwt-form.jar in the jbpm console server war), or you could use the Guvnor
  process repository to store your forms as well.  Check out the chapter on the
  process repository to get more information on how to do that.</para>

  </section>
  
  <section>
    <title>REST interface</title>

    <para>The console also offers a REST interface for the functionality it exposes.  This
    for example allows easy integration with the process engine for features like starting
    process instances, retrieving task lists, etc.</para>
    
    <para>The list URLS that the REST interface exposes can be inspected if you navigate
    to the following URL (after installing and starting the console):</para>
    <para><ulink url="http://localhost:8080/gwt-console-server/rs/server/resources">http://localhost:8080/gwt-console-server/rs/server/resources</ulink></para>
    
    <para>For example, this allows you to close a task using</para>
    <para>/gwt-console-server/rs/task/{taskId}/close</para>
    <para>or starting a new process instance using</para>
    <para>/gwt-console-server/rs/process/definition/{id}/new_instance</para>
